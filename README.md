# docker-practice

This code has a client and server part in client.py and server.py

## Running server.py

- this is the one you want to run first
- navigate to the location of the server.py file
- run the command below replacing python with your systems command for python 3
- you may add an optional port # after the command if you want to use another port.

```
python server.py
```

## Running client.py
- navigate to the location of the server.py file
- run the command below replacing python with your systems command for python 3
- you may add an optional port # after the command if you are using another port for the server.

```
python client.py localhost
```

That's it! everything should work from there!
